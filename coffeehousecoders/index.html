	<p class="content">Coffee house coders is a group of technology enthusiasts who get together every week to socialize, eat, drink, and hack on pet projects. Coffee house coders is hosted by NORLUG, however Linux is not required! Feel free to bring whatever computer you have!</p>
    <p class="content">Coffee house coders provides a great opportunity for people who want to learn something new in a social, informal setting. Students are welcome to bring class projects and get insights into the professional world of software development outside of the classroom. While most of us at CHC are software professionals or hobbyists, we welcome anyone who wants to learn anything about computers!</p>
